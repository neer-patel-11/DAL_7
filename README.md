# üõ∞Ô∏è Multi-Class Model Selection: ROC & Precision-Recall Analysis

## üìã Assignment Overview

**Topic:** Multi-Class Classification using ROC and Precision-Recall Curves  
**Dataset:** UCI Landsat Satellite (6-class land cover classification)

This assignment explores model selection for a complex multi-class classification problem using comprehensive evaluation metrics beyond simple accuracy.

## üéØ Objectives

- Train and compare 6 different classifiers (KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Dummy Classifier)
- Implement **One-vs-Rest (OvR)** approach for multi-class ROC and PRC analysis
- Generate **macro-averaged ROC curves** and **Precision-Recall curves**
- Compare model performance across different decision thresholds
- Understand trade-offs between ROC-AUC and Precision-Recall metrics
- Identify models with AUC < 0.5 and analyze their behavior
